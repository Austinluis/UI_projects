PROJECT 2
* cal.py: implements a simple calculator with a menu prompting the user for a selection between addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus
* guess.py: randomly picks an integer from 1 to 100, prompts user for guesses and informs user if their guess is more or less. The game only terminates when the user guesses the correct number
